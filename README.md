# Flask Workshop

## From discussion on Wednesday 02/03/16

### Timeline (expected time: 1hr 20mins)
* Why Web Development? (5 mins)
* Overview of HTML/CSS/JS (10 - 15 mins)
* Flask (1 hr) 


## Why Web Development?

### Pros   
* Crossplatform, OS does not matter, you only need a browser
* Easy to get started, static pages only need 3 files, HTML, CSS and a JS one
* Vast amount of documentation, most GitHub repos are web related projects
* Makes you a marketable developer

### Cons
* Can be easily lost in the vastness of the tools found on the web, must be selective about what to learn
* Not for the faint of heart, must be motivated!


## HTML / CSS / JS Overview

### HTML
* Gives the page structure, see snippets

### CSS 
* Control the page's aesthetics, see snippets

### JS 
* Create interctaions for the page, events
* Check out the Javascript workshop
