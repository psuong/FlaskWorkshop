# Flask Workshop

### Timeline (expected time: 1hr 20mins)
* Why Web Development? (5 mins)
* Overview of HTML/CSS/JS (10 - 15 mins)
* Flask (1 hr) 

## Why Web Development?

### Pros   
* Crossplatform, OS does not matter, you only need a browser
* Easy to get started, static pages only need 3 files, HTML, CSS and a JS one
* Vast amount of documentation, most GitHub repos are web related projects
* Makes you a marketable developer

### Cons
* Can be easily lost in the vastness of the tools found on the web, must be selective about what to learn
* Not for the faint of heart, must be motivated!


## HTML / CSS / JS Overview

### HTML
* Gives the page structure, see snippets

### CSS 
* Control the page's aesthetics, see snippets

### JS 
* Create interctaions for the page, events
* Check out the Javascript workshop 

## What is a framework, why use them?
* HTML/CSS/JS creates static pages
* How do web pages become interactive? need a webserver (another computer)
* Frameworks simplify development by providing 3 main things
  * a url dispatcher
  * a templating engine
  * a object relational mapper (ORM)


## Flask

### Setting up a Python environment
* Check that Python is installed and get pip
* Why are virtual environments necessary? 

### Finally some Flask
* Hello world in Flask
* Templating | URL dispatching | no ORM
* Create a simple application list application (Pokemon list)


# Where to go from here
* Lots of sites offer online courses, these will help you learn fundamentals, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy, etc
* Most topics are google-able, so it's actually hard not to get overwhelmed by the amount of resources out there 
* Happy coding! :)
