## Templates

Templates are a way to dynamically change content of a webpage without having to modify the HTML directly or create new HTML files that have the content you need.

Content you need on specific webpages can instead be loaded through a function in your Flask app. Templating in Flask is done through Jinja2, you can view the API [here](http://jinja.pocoo.org).
