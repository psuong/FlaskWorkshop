# HTML Review

### Basic document structure
* Need for a DOCTYPE to tell the browser that html is being rendered, otherwise page might not render properly 
* After the doctype, a html tag follows that has in it, a head and body tag
* Define lang attribute in the the html tag, the charset in meta tag, and add title, which is what is displayed on the tab

### Most common HTML tags
* headings ```<h1> - <h6>```
* paragraph ```<p>```
* links ```<a>```
* list (ordered and unordered) ```<ul>, <ol>```
* image ```<img>```
* division ```<div>```

### Some CSS, how it works 
* 3 ways to do it, inline, style tag inside html file or an external file (preferred)
* add main.css file
* targetting html tags and changing their attributes
* color, background color, make the list inline, shrink the image and box the division
* targetting elements with classes and ids, ie. navbar, footer, etc
